# Stock Network Analysis

This project proposes new approach to cluster stock data. I used network analysis to define relationship among stocks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
pip install networkx
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Progress

 1. calculate monthly return rate of each stock
 2. calculate monthly sector return rate
 3. calculate correlation among sectors
 4. visulaize sector network
 
### result
 1. degree
  ![degree](./img/degree)
 2. network
  ![network](./img/network)
